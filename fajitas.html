                    <p>This is a very easy and healthy recipe. It has a lot of flavor and is also perfect for mealpreping. I just put a tortilla on a plate and the desired amount of fajita from the fridge. Then I microwave it for about 1 minute, 30 seconds and then add Salsa and Sour Cream on. You can either use fresh chicken breasts, or defrosted if you have time to defrost them in the fridge for about a day. Have bell peppers in different colors for a nicer presentation.</p>

                        <li>Put the chicken on a plate, sprinkle and rub the seasoning with a bit of raps-oil so it covers all the chicken pieces, and put it in the fridge for about an hour if you have the time, you don't have to wait, but it might help the chicken to marinate a bit.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>Heat up a large heating pan with a little bit of oil to medium heat. Add the chickens and cook them for about 10 minutes on each side. Make sure to not have to high heat, as it risks to burn the seasoning. You can take out the largest piece and cut it in the middle after this time frame, to make sure that the chicken is cooked through, which it must be.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>While the chicken is cooking, chop up the onion and bell peppers to long strips</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>Remove the chicken once they are fully cooked, and let them rest for a bit. Add all the vegetables to the same pan and stir them on medium to high heat for about 8 minutes.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>While cooking the vegetables, cut the chicken into strips.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>Turn off the heat, and add back the chicken to the pan. Stir everything together for a few minutes, and top it all of with the juice from half of a lime</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>Put the fajita on a whole wheat tortilla. Add desired amount of salsa and sour cream. Fold and enjoy. You can also make it to a fajita bowl, by replacing the tortilla with with whole grain rice or salad</li>
