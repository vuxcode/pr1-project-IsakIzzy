# Project Instructions
Follow the instructions here: https://vuxcode.netlify.app/new/pr1/lessons/major-project-brief/

REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Notes

I think I need to divide the site into three different sections. Left section, middle section and right section. The Left and Right sections should be equally large, the middle section however, should be a bit larger, since it has more text then the other ones. I think the left and right sections needs to be split up into two, vertically for the two different parts on each one. 

Maybe I use too many div classes now. But I like to use it a lot for organization. 

I need to add some content to divs for it to appear..
Now the divs are devided on different lines. Gotta get them to be next to each other. 
I think I have all the divs I need now. They just aren't lined up the way I want them to yet. 
Is Github gonna be able to save Swedish characters, or do I need to add something for it to work?
